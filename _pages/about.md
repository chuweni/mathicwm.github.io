I have broad interests in applied mathematics, particularly in mathematical physics, numerical analysis/scientific computing, and quantum computing. Currently, my research primarily focuses on two areas:
- high-order unfitted finite element methods for dynamic interface problems;
- quantum computing for partial differential equations.
